# Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS: Development tools and Techniques
This session picks up where the Customizing and Extending Web AppBuilder session leaves off, and will cover advanced tools and techniques to help you streamline and automate the development of custom widgets and themes for Web AppBuilder using the latest JavaScript and styling tooling, including:
 * Automating file management and integration with version control systems using Grunt
 * Scaffolding widgets using Yeoman generators
 * Writing widgets that use modern JavaScript that can be tested and used outside of the Web AppBuilder
